# Litematica Rewrite

`NOTE: This mod is barely started and is not ready for use. There are no current changes to Litematica, but I have set up the repository so that I may work on it `

Litematica was a mod created from the vision of Schematica. It was originally made for LiteLoader, but has been ported for fabric and the latest version of Minecraft.
Litematica has confusing config windows, complex controls, and is extremely difficult to navigate. The goal of this repository is to streamline the code and fix this usability issue.

This repository in particular is forked from https://github.com/sakura-ryoko/litematica, a community updated version
