# Litematica Rewrite

***NOTE: This mod is barely started and is not ready for use. There are no current changes to Litematica, but I have set up the repository so that I may work on it ***

==============
Litematica is a client-side Minecraft mod using LiteLoader.
It is more or less a re-creation of or a substitute for [Schematica](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/schematica),
for players who don't want to have Forge installed.
For compiled builds (= downloads), see http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/litematica

Compiling
=========
* Clone the repository
* Open a command prompt/terminal to the repository directory
* run 'gradlew build'
* The built jar file will be in build/libs/
